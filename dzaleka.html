          <h2>Dzaleka Refugee Camp Chess Club</h2>
          <p style="text-align:left">
            In the summer of 2025, Lightning Square Chess Club proudly launched a new Chess Club Bootstrap Program at Dzaleka Refugee Camp in Malawi. Established in 1994, Dzaleka is Malawi’s largest refugee settlement, home to individuals and families who have fled conflict and violence in Burundi, Rwanda, and the Democratic Republic of Congo.<br/><br/>
Despite significant challenges—including unstable internet access and logistical difficulties in shipping chess sets—Coach Kally Wen led the program with remarkable dedication and passion. Thanks to her leadership, students at Dzaleka have made tremendous progress over the summer. We are continually inspired by their resilience, determination, and joy for learning, and we look forward with excitement to the remarkable achievements that lie ahead.

          "Coach Kally is an extraordinary teacher and mentor. She combines deep chess knowledge with a rare gift of communication, making even the most complex strategies easy to grasp. Her patience, encouragement, and ability to inspire excellence in every student, especially me, make her one of the best coaches I have ever encountered. She creates an atmosphere where we all feel motivated to push beyond our limits. Despite the distance between the USA and Malawi, she manages to make each class feel personal, engaging, and unforgettable. Coach Kally is not only shaping us into better chess players but also into better thinkers."
