          <p style="text-align:left">
            Matheku Secondary School is a public, no-fee institution situated in the rural area of the Bhekeshowe Tribal Authority, just outside Eshowe in KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa. While the students demonstrate remarkable potential and a strong enthusiasm for learning, the school faces significant challenges due to limited resources and a lack of funding for extracurricular activities. Recognizing this gap, we partnered with the school to help establish its very first chess club—an initiative designed to nurture critical thinking, strategic skills, and personal growth among the learners. <br/><br/> 
            Coach Kally Wen, together with our local partner Siphelele Myeni—a dedicated teacher at Matheku Secondary—worked closely to overcome various obstacles in bringing this project to life. We are thrilled to see the students making impressive progress, and we’re proud that the chess club has been successfully launched and is thriving.
