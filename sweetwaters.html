          <p style="text-align:left">
            Sweetwaters Girls Secondary School is located in Laikipia Central Sub-County, within Laikipia County, Kenya. Situated just 10 kilometers from Nanyuki town and near the renowned Ol Pejeta Conservancy, the school serves a vibrant community of young women eager to learn and grow. Despite a strong interest in chess among students, the school had never been able to establish a chess club due to limited resources. <br/><br/> 
            When Mr. Erick Okengo, a dedicated teacher at Sweetwaters Girls Secondary School, reached out to us, we recognized a perfect match for our Club Bootstrap Program. Sweetwaters became our very first partner under this initiative. In January 2025, Coach Kally Wen and Coach Luke Widjaja collaborated with Mr. Okengo to officially launch the Sweetwaters Girls Chess Club, bringing new opportunities for strategic thinking, confidence-building, and community engagement to the students.
