          <h2>Ansar-ud-deen College Chess Club</h2>
          <p style="text-align:left">
            Ansar-ud-deen College, Isolo, is a co-educational institution in Nigeria, founded in 1953 and recognized as one of the first-generation schools in Lagos, serving students from grades 7 to 12. The college has a long tradition of integrating sports activities to support students' all-round development. At the other hand, although more and more students have shown interest in chess, the school lacked resource to provide proper chess coaching. As a result, the need to establish a dedicated chess club became increasingly pressing. To address this issue, Coach Sean from Lightning Square Chess Club collaborated with the school through the Club Bootstrap Program. By working closely with Teacher Jimoh Olufunke Monsurat, they overcame all challenges, ensured the smooth implementation of online lessons, and successfully established the Ansar-ud-deen College Chess Club. This initiative now provides students with structured training, fosters critical thinking, and opens up new opportunities for competition and personal growth. </br> </br>
            Coach Sean led weekly chess training sessions for 20 students, all of whom demonstrated a strong passion for the game. In addition, Coach Sean and Coach Luke provided specialized coaching to four students in preparation for their debut representing the school at the LAFGHECA competition, an event held among first-generation schools in Lagos State. Competing against 25 schools, Ansarudeen College earned an impressive fifth-place finish. This achievement had a positive impact on the school community and further reinforced the decision to establish a chess club formally. As a representative of Lightning Square Chess Club, Coach Sean donated 10 chess sets to support the Ansar-ud-deen College Chess Club.

            “The Chess Bootstrap program is a wonderful, interesting and helpful program for the students of the school. The students who are part of the program have learnt a lot and are always eager and looking forward to Wednesdays when we normally have the class. There has been improvement for them because I witnessed them taking part in activities and responding to questions. </br> </br>
            Coach Sean is a coach with great personality, he is patient and knows how to get the attention of the students by teachings them techniques that will enhance the students' learning of the game. He has been very consistent and is also patient when we run late or have power supply and internet disruptions. He is chess savvy and has been able to impact on the students in a short while.
 Presently, many other students who are not part of the program are making enquiry on how to join.”
